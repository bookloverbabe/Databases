# Test-driving write operations

_**This is a Makers Vine.** Vines are designed to gradually build up sophisticated skills.

Learn to test-drive "Repository" class methods to INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.

## Demonstration

[Here's a video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQMipxm2hQ8) of designing the create, delete and update methods.

## The `create` method

The process to follow is the same you used for the previous methods ‚Äî but the operation we want to implement is to insert new records.

Here is a design for the `create` method of the example class `StudentRepository`:

| Method      |Job| Arguments | SQL query                                     | Returns  |
| ----------- |----|-----------| ----------------------------------------------|----------|
| `create`      |Insert a student| A `Student` object | `INSERT INTO students (name, cohort_name) VALUES ($1, $2); ` | - |


As the `INSERT` query contains some dynamic parts (the new values to insert), we need to use SQL parameters as well.

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO students (name, cohort_name) VALUES ($1, $2);
  ```

Here is the expected behaviour for the method:

```ruby
repository = StudentRepository.new

# Build a new model object
student = Student.new
student.name = 'Alice'
student.cohort_name = 'February 2022'

repository.create(student) # Performs the INSERT query

# Performs a SELECT query to get all records (implemented previously)
all_students = repository.all 

# all_students should contain the student 'Alice' created above.
```

## The `delete` method

The design of the `delete` method is similar to the `find` method previously implemented ‚Äî taking an ID as an argument. However, it runs a `DELETE` SQL query to delete a specific row.

| Method      |Job| Arguments | SQL query                                     | Returns  |
| ----------- |----|-----------| ----------------------------------------------|----------|
| `delete`      |Delete a student| A (numeric) `id` | `DELETE FROM students WHERE id = $1;` | - |

Here is the expected behaviour for the method:

```ruby
repository = StudentRepository.new

# Delete the student with id=1
repository.delete(1)

repository.all # The student with id=1 should now be removed.
```

## Exercise

_Work in the project directory `music_library` you've worked on before._

Test-drive the method `.create` on the class `AlbumRepository` from the previous project
`music_library`.

```ruby
repository = AlbumRepository.new

album = Album.new
album.title = 'Trompe le Monde'
album.release_year = 1991
album.artist_id = 1

repository.create(album)

all_albums = repository.all

# The all_albums array should contain the new Album object
```

1. Encode the expected behaviour above as a new test for the `AlbumRepository` class.
2. Implement the `.create` method to make this test pass.

## Challenge

This is a process feedback challenge. That means you should record yourself doing it and
submit that recording to your coach for feedback. [How do I do
this?](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square/blob/main/pills/process_feedback_challenges.md)

This is a big one! To work on this challenge, first:
  * Setup a new project directory `social_network`.
  * Create a new database `social_network`.

Then:

1. Design the two tables for the following user stories.  

    ```
    As a social network user,
    So I can have my information registered,
    I'd like to have a user account with my email address.

    As a social network user,
    So I can have my information registered,
    I'd like to have a user account with my username.

    As a social network user,
    So I can write on my timeline,
    I'd like to create posts associated with my user account.

    As a social network user,
    So I can write on my timeline,
    I'd like each of my posts to have a title and a content.

    As a social network user,
    So I can know who reads my posts,
    I'd like each of my posts to have a number of views.
    ```

2. Test-drive the Model and Repository classes for these two tables.
    * You should end up with two Model classes and two Repository classes.
    * You should test-drive and implement the four methods `all`, `find`, `create` and
      `delete` for each Repository class.

3. If you'd like an extra challenge, test-drive as well an `update` method for both classes, which updates a specific record.

[After you're done, submit your recording
