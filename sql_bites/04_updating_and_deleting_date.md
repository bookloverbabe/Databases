Learn to write `UPDATE` and `DELETE` SQL queries.

## Introduction

In this section you'll learn about two other type of SQL queries, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` which, as their name implies, are used to update and delete records.

## Updating records

To update existing records, you can use an UPDATE statement. Let‚Äôs look at how to do that for all records and then for a subset of records.

The general syntax of the `UPDATE` query is:

```sql
UPDATE [table name] SET [column_name] = [new_value];
```

### Updating several records

Here's a simple example of how to build an `UPDATE` query:

```sql
UPDATE albums SET title = 'A new title';
```
This will update the title column of all the records in the albums table.

We can also update several columns at once when creating an UPDATE query: 

```sql
UPDATE [table name] SET [column_name] = [new_value], [other_column_name] = [other_new_value];
```
```sql
UPDATE albums SET title = 'New title', release_year = '2020';
```
This will update the titles and dates of all the records of the albums table. 

### Updating specific records

We can also use the `WHERE` keyword to specify conditions, like for `SELECT` queries. Only records matching these conditions will be updated.

```sql
UPDATE [table name] SET [column_name] = [new_value]
  WHERE [conditions];
```

```sql
UPDATE albums SET title = 'New title'
  WHERE date='16th of November 2020';
```

## Deleting records

The `DELETE` query has a slightly different syntax, but works in a similar fashion.

Make sure you **always** specify conditions when using `DELETE` (unless you have good reasons not to), to avoid deleting the entire table.

```sql
DELETE FROM [table name] WHERE [conditions];

-- Or, delete all records (never do this!)
DELETE FROM [table name];
```

## Demonstration

[Here's a video demonstration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wT1FVQbPZw&t=1710s) Make sure you attempt the exercise before watching the solution.

## Exercise

Update the `release_year` of the album with ID `3` to the value `1972`.

Use a `SELECT` query to get that specific record and verify it has been updated.

## Challenge

1. Update the title and release_year of the album with ID 1 (in a single query). Then use a SELECT query to get the list of albums and verify that one has been updated.

2. Delete the album with ID 12. Then use a SELECT query to get the list of albums and verify that one has been deleted.
